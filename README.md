## 🎯 Project Overview

This project identifies three species of hornets and wasps:
- **🐝 European Hornet** (*Vespa crabro*) - Large, brown-yellow hornets
- **🔴 Asian Hornet** (*Vespa velutina*) - Invasive species with yellow legs
- **🟡 Common Wasp** (*Vespula sp.*) - Typical yellow and black wasps

### 🌟 Key Features
- ✅ **Live Web Application**: Upload images and get instant results
- ✅ **High Accuracy**: 97.8% classification accuracy using YOLO + ResNet50
- ✅ **Image Display**: Shows both uploaded image and prediction results
- ✅ **User-Friendly Names**: "European Hornet" instead of "Vespa crabro"
- ✅ **Confidence Scores**: Visual probability bars for all species
- ✅ **Multiple Model Comparison**: CNN, ResNet50, Vision Transformer tested
- ✅ **YOLO Integration**: Object detection improves classification by 74%
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Docker containerized with FastAPI backend
